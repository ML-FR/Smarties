# Smarties :art:


Smarties is a Text Classifier using an innovative approach based on Wikipedia auto-learning to classify 
any documents/text. We use a Machine Learning and Doc2Vec algorithms.

## Getting Started :beginner:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine 
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project 
on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have python 3.+ install on your machine. 

### Installing
```
pip install Smarties
```

### Example :round_pushpin:
```
wiki_dico_path = "wiki_dico.json"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    #construct the knowledge base to a wiki_dico.json file
    sm.ConstructWikiDico(wiki_dico_path, 'Soccer', 'Soccer')
    sm.ConstructWikiDico(wiki_dico_path, 'Baseball', 'Baseball')
    sm.ConstructWikiDico(wiki_dico_path, 'Golf', 'Golf')
    sm.ConstructWikiDico(wiki_dico_path, 'Basketball', 'Basketball')
    sm.ConstructWikiDico(wiki_dico_path, 'Judo', 'Judo')
    
    #Construct and import database from our database previously defined
    sm.ConstructDatabaseFromKnwoledgebase(wiki_dico_path,database_file_ouput="database_file_custom_name.csv")
    df = sm.ImportDatabase(database_file = "database_file_custom_name.csv")

    #Run model training
    classifier,model,df = sm.ModelFromDatabase(df)

    sentence_to_predict = "An individual's, nation's, or organization's carbon footprint can be measured by undertaking a GHG emissions assessment or other calculative activities denoted as carbon accounting. "

    #Predict the class of our sample
    sm.Predict(classifier,model,df,sentence_to_predict)
```

### TODO :grin:
Please feel free to contribute ! Report any bugs in the issue section. 

- [ ] Complete Code documentation and README
- [x] Build a basis code
- [x] Text processing (Clean, tokenizing,...)
- [x] Wikipedia auto-search by class
- [x] Database creation from a json (Wikipedia learning, Datastructure, sampling..)
- [x] Create text classification algorithm (RAKE, GridSearch, RFC, Doc2Vec)
- [x] Input example and return classification
